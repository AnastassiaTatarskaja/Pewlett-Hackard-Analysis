# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview of the analysis:

Using SQL query, I have prepared a report for Bobbyâ€™s manager that identifies and summarizes employees who have reached retirement age. 

##Results:

- There are a total of 30,399 employees who have reached retirement age, out of 331,604 total employees.
- 30,399 of retirees make up about 9% of the total number of employees. 
- Retirees are comprised of a wide range of titles, starting with staff to senior engineer. 
- There are 1,550(about0.5%) employees with mentorship eligibility. Compared with the employees who are retirement ready, there may not be enough qualified employees who can provide mentorship to new employees. Possibly, a company can have a plan to have retirement ready personnel retiring using a scaffolding method with will help the company with onboarding of new employees.



##Summary:
According to the data, the company has about 9% of employees who are ready to retire and about 0.5% employees with mentorship eligibility. Some additional information that could help the company is to create a table with number of departments what will be affected by the potential retirees as well as a table with titles of employees eligible for retirement. It will help the company prepare a plan to fill positions in the near future.
